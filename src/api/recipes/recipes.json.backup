Remove from heat, keep covered and let rest 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a small saucepan combine 4 Tbsp of the vinegar with the sugar and salt. Heat over medium heat, cook and whisk until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat, let cool while rice is resting then pour vinegar mixture over rice and toss to evenly coat.\nIn a small mixing bowl whisk together mayonnaise with sriracha. Thin with 1 1/2 tsp of water if desired. Transfer to a sandwich size resealable bag. Set aside.\nIn a small mixing bowl whisk together soy sauce and remaining 1 Tbsp vinegar, set aside. In a large mixing bowl gently toss together crab meat, cucumber, carrots, nori, ginger and avocado. Divide prepared rice among 4 or 5 bowls. Top with crab mixture then spoon soy sauce mixture over top of each serving. Cut a small tip from one corner of the resealable bag holding the sriracha mixture, drizzle over each serving.

      "directions": "Looking for a new slow cooker recipe to feed the troops? This Fiesta Chicken Crockpot Recipe is a great one to add to the rotation!\nYou might have seen this recipe around the internet this past week… my Fiesta Chicken crockpot recipe. Those of you who have been reading my site for a while might have recognized my kitchen anyway…\nI make this for dinner often. It is a simple, easy and DELICIOUS chicken crock pot recipe that my kids love. I love it as well for that matter…\nAnyway, I was in a hurry and made it for dinner last week and was out of a few ingredients and made some substitutions. It looked really pretty when I had it all together and so I snapped a picture and figured I would let you guys know what I was having for dinner.\nWell, 26 MILLION people saw my picture last week with over 550,000 shares of my picture & recipe!! (Then of course you have countless people who stole my picture and reposted exactly my word for word comments and directions as their own, and those were shared a crazy number of times…) But in the end, it is a DANG good chicken recipe!\nI was out of the standard Ranch packet you are supposed to dump on the top, but I had this packet of Fiesta Ranch and so I used that… OMGosh! It made it soooooo good!!\nThis recipe is sooooo easy! You can use raw, frozen or unfrozen chicken. You dump it all in the crockpot, sprinkle the dip packet over it all, and then cook it on high for 4 hours or 6 on low. Then shred the chicken with forks and mix it all up. It looks a little sketchy at this point, but don’t worry. Then we make rice, and serve this over the rice using tortillas to scoop it up OR you can just make chicken tacos. So many choices!\nIf it is a little soupy that is ok. Leave the lid off for a little bit and the liquid will disappear. I think it is good with a little sauce though personally.\nInstead of the usual Rotel I used petite diced tomatoes drained, as my little kids don’t like the spice from Rotel.\nThe cream cheese doesn’t need to cook all day with the chicken. In fact, it might curdle if you boil it. I typically toss it in about 40 minutes before we eat, it just needs to get soft enough for you to stir in.\n**If you don’t feel like heading into the store for all your shopping list for this, you might try the Walmart Grocery Pickup if it’s available in your area (there’s coupon codes all the time)\nCook on high in the slow cooker for 4 hours or 6 on low. Shred with forks and eat over rice with tortillas.\nIf using the Instant Pot, use raw chicken. Cover the chicken with the ingredients listed. Press the poultry button then add 5 minutes to cook the chicken for a total of 20 minutes (some prefer 25 minutes).\nThe Instant Pot will release the pressure. Your chicken will be ready to shred and serve!\nThis Hamilton Beach Stay or Go is currently my favorite Crock Pot. I needed to get one with the latch over the top after one too many spills while taking dinner to a party, friends, or church. Plus they are often 50% off or more with free shipping.\nIf you are having a hard time finding the Fiesta Ranch in your grocery store, they are in all of mine by the salad dressing usually on the top shelf, you can order some Fiesta Ranch HERE.\nIf you like Crock Pot recipes as much as I do, I put together a few of my FAVORITE easy Crock Pot recipes in one place. Head on over HERE to check them out!",

Let coals burn until covered with ash and glowing red with no black remaining.\nPlace packs side by side directly onto hot coals or grill and cook, rotating with tongs occasionally, about 5 minutes. Carefully remove 1 pack from heat and check if ingredients are steaming hot. If necessary, return pack to coals and continue to cook, 5–10 minutes more.\nTransfer packs with tongs to a flat surface and carefully open them (they will be full of hot steam). Top each pack with spinach, then crack 1 egg into the center of each and season with salt and pepper. Reseal, return to coals, and cook until egg whites are opaque but yolks are still runny, 4–5 minutes.\nCarefully remove packs from coals, open, and sprinkle with cheddar, if using. Serve immediately.\nPacks can be assembled and chilled for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month.",

Chicken breasts seasoned in a honey-mustard sauce are baked in foil to a tender finish with juicy grape tomatoes and zucchini. You’ll love the simplicity!\nServes: 4\nPre-heat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Lay four 12×12 inch (30×30 cm) squares of foil out on a flat surface. Place zucchini slices, tomatoes in the middle of each piece of foil. Season with salt and pepper, then top with each chicken fillet. Season chicken with salt and pepper, to taste.\nIn a small bowl, combine olive oil, minced garlic, mustard, and honey. Divide the sauce over each chicken pack and sprinkle with crushed chili pepper and chopped parsley.\nFold the foil over the chicken and vegetables to close off the pack, pinch the ends together so the pack stays closed.\nTransfer the packs to a baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and veggies are tender. Serve immediately and open carefully. Enjoy with an additional touch of parsley!\nNote: If chicken breasts are too thick, just cut lengthwise to make fillets, they will cook faster.\nClick here for more low effort dinner recipes.",

      "directions": "“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.\nOnce the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.\nGrease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.\nPunch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.\nLightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.\nPreheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.\nMeanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.\nOnce the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.\nThen, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.\nSprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.\nSlide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.\nAdd any garnish of your preference.\nEnjoy!",
