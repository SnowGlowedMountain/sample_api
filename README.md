# Sample APIs 2.0

Sample APIs has been given a major overhaul. Due to the fact Now.sh has changed the way their servers work, we have had to rethink how the system was built. Over all, the changes are for the better. It is now easier than ever to contribute.

## Purpose

Understanding RESTful APIs is hard enough, even without including an authentication mechanism. The sole purpose of this repository is to play with RESTful endpoints and learn. We have a few endpoints that you can start playing around with right away! If you are not finding anything you are interested in, create your own endpoints and/or submit a pull request. Take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jermbo/SampleAPIs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get involved.

## Changes

The changes with Now.sh has forced us to embrace Express as well as JSON Server in different ways. We now have a single point on entry for all apis, where previously we had to duplicate efforts in multiple places. The API files and the backups have been isolated causing a URL change.
